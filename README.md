# Search Drives

This is a collection of scripts to search for files on a drive or in a directory. This includes searching for files by name or patterns like `*.txt` or `*.jpg`. The results are saved to a text file including the full path to the file. You can then choose to copy all results to a new directory. No external libraries, installation or admin rights are required.
